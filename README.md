The Tree
========

There's a basic problem which is solved over and over again which looks something like the following:

```
  Superuser
      |
Region Manager
      |
 Area Manager
      |
Outlet Manager
      |
   Customer
```

This is "The Tree" - every Web developer will have to implement it sooner or later. As such it's a really
good test case for a Web framework - in this case, Spring MVC and Hibernate.

Why? Because I'll need to do it sooner or later...
